<h3>Are you ready to learn about me?</h3>
<h2>Things I love</h2>
<p>I absolutely <span>adore</span> performing on stage!<br>
Singing is my greatest passion, and I do it as often as I can.</p>
<p>I also love reading.<br>
My favorite series right now is the Stormlight Archives by Brandon Sanderson.</p>
<pre>and now I've run out of creative ways to fulfill the html rubric demands &lt;&gt;</pre>
